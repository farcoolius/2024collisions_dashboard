# Seattle Traffic Collisions Dashboard (2024)

This interactive dashboard visualizes traffic collisions across Seattle in 2024 using a dynamic web map and chart. The goal of this dashboard is to help users explore spatial patterns in collision distribution and understand how number of collisions vary across different areas of the city. By integrating a map with collision locations across Seattle, the dashboard allows users to analyze both geographic and categorical trends simultaneously.

## Thematic Map Design Choice
I chose to visualize a proportional map to symbolize collision density. Traffic collions are considered to be point based events, this would allow viewers to immediately identiy spatial hotspots. This thematic approach balances readability and spatial accuracy, making it easier to interpret the dataset since it has more 8,000 results in just one year time frame.

## Other Components Used
 * Interactive features zooming in and out 
 * Reseting the map view
 * Updates statistics when map is zoomed in or out.
 * Highlights dominate collision category in each area.
